> __Positive Affirmation of the day:__

> Young children tend to be sincere science enthusiasts, but if you talk to kids in the 12th grade much of this curiosity has become extinguished.

> If our natural tendency to logically question things is discouraged and we are instead rewarded for actions that we often don't see the meaning of, the brain adapts to this and gradually gives up on independent logical inquiry. Instead we become disproportionately dedicated to seeking the approval of others. Our opinions, our identity, our way of life ends up depending on how we are judged by our social circle and by society at large.
